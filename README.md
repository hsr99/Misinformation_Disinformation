MULTImodal Fake News Detection and Verification 

Our cutting-edge project decisively tackles the pervasive challenge of misinformation in today's digital landscape. We deploy state-of-the-art AI tools and advanced large language models to detect and categorize misleading content across various media formatsâ€”including videos, audios, images, and text. By meticulously curating expansive datasets and developing sophisticated deep learning (DL) models in NLP and computer vision, we have pioneered a robust, multimodal approach.

Our primary goal is to achieve unparalleled accuracy in detecting misinformation. Leveraging multimodal analysis and real-time parallel processing capabilities, we ensure the swift and precise identification of deceptive content. This innovative solution not only addresses the complexities of today's digital misinformation but also sets a new industry standard in combating falsehoods, fostering a more informed and trustworthy online environment.

With our deep learning approach, we are at the forefront of technological advancement, offering a comprehensive solution that embodies both cutting-edge research and practical application.
